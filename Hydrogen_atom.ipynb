        "**BUILDING A QUANTUM ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE MODEL:**\n",
        "\n",
        "A quantum AI model is the one that leverages the principles of quantum computing to enhance or optimize the performance of traditional AI algorithms.\n",
        "\n",
        "Deep learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence which is all about training the neural networks i.e., using the data to get the right values for each neuron to be able to predict what we want.\n",
        "Training deep learning AI systems requires massive amounts of data and computational power. This can take minutes to weeks and in the process, it consumes a lot of energy and computational resources.Quantum computing is one of the solution to this problem related to better coomputational efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is a quantum AI model which solves one of the most famous problem in quantum chemistry: The lowest energy level or the ground state energy of H2 molecule which is the most stable state!\n",
        "\n",
        "But what is the significance of finding the ground state energy:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Stability: Ground state represents the most stable configuration of the system and finding this would help us understand and predict the behaviour,stability and reactivity of the molecules.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Drug design: In drug discovery knowing the ground state of molecules helps in understanding how drugs interact with biological targets, leading to more effective treatments.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Properties of materials: The ground state determines many properties of materials, such as electrical conductivity, magnetism, and superconductivity. Understanding the ground state can lead to the design of new materials with desirable properties.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Quantum Optimization: Many optimization problems can be framed as finding the ground state of a corresponding quantum system. The energy landscape of the system represents the solution space, and the ground state corresponds to the optimal solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "What are the challenges in finding the ground state energy:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The state of a quantum system is described by a wavefunction, which resides in a high-dimensional space called Hilbert space. The size of this space grows exponentially with the number of particles or degrees of freedom in the system, making it extraordinarily difficult to explore and find the ground state using classical methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. The energy landscape of a quantum system can be extremely complex, with many local minimas. Finding the global minimum (ground state) is challenging because algorithms can easily get trapped in these local minima.\n",
        "\n",
        "With quantum computing, the qubits represent electrons, which can directly simulate the electrons in the molecules.\n",
        "\n",
        "VQE (Variational Quantum Algorithm) which is a hybrid algorithm that leverages both the properties of classsical and quantum computing is used to find the ground state energy of H2 molecule. The code is designed to run on a quantum simulator (which is a classical computer running a quantum algorithm).\n",

        "An ansatz is a parametrized quantum circuit designed to prepare a trial quantum state. The parameters of the ansatz are adjusted to minimize the expectation value of the Hamiltonian, which corresponds to finding the ground state energy of the system. We then initialize the basis state as |0000> and in the context of the H2 molecule, starting from a specific basis state ensures that the ansatz begins from a known reference state, typically the ground state in the computational basis for each qubit."
